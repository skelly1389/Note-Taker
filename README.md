## Installation

[Live application available here!](https://dry-river-82057.herokuapp.com/)

## Usage

From the home page, click the get started button. User is then presented with previously saved notes to the left of the page and a form on the right. After entering a title and note body a save button appears allowing the note to be saved. Clicking on a saved note's title will display that note's body on the page. Clicking the pencil allows the user to enter a new note.
